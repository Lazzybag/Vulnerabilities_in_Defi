# Vulnerabilities_in_Defi

## üîç Overview
This repository contains real-world simulations and reconstructions of known DeFi protocol vulnerabilities, including but not limited to:
- Oracle price manipulation
- Flashloan-based arbitrage exploits
- AMM pool desynchronization attacks

## üö® Legal Notice
This project is strictly intended for:
- **Educational purposes**
- **Security research**
- **Authorized auditing engagements** (with written consent from protocol teams)

We **do not** support or condone the use of these tools for illegal or malicious activity. All exploits demonstrated here are either:
- Simulated in a safe testing environment, or
- Replicated **only with explicit authorization** from audited protocols.

If you are a DeFi project looking to assess or reproduce known vulnerabilities for internal testing, please contact the repository owner.

## üìÅ Structure
The repo will contain:
- `contracts/`: Solidity contracts for known exploit patterns  
- `scripts/`: Hardhat deployment + attack scripts  
- `audit-reports/`: Case studies or logs of verified simulations  
- `.env.example`: Environment variable template for sensitive data  
- `README.md`: This document

## ü§ù Ethics
This repository follows responsible disclosure principles and supports whitehat security research only.
